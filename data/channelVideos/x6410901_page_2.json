But nothing compares to seeing F-150 Raptor do what it does best.\n\nShot on the same Mojave Desert terrain where F-150 Raptor was designed and tested to excel, this video is a six-part series that shows why F-150 Raptor is the ultimate high-performance off-road pickup truck.\n\nForged from high-strength, military-grade, aluminum alloy that helps the truck shed more than 500 pounds, F-150 Raptor is inspired by Ford\u2019s performance heritage in off-road racing that includes Best in the Desert, Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series and the famous Baja 1000.\n\nRedesigned, larger FOX Racing Shox with more suspension travel and all-new terrain management technology help F-150 Raptor tackle the toughest of surfaces. An available Torsen front differential increases off-road capability further.\n\nThe all-new 2017 Raptor is powered by Ford\u2019s new, second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost\u00ae engine, with more horsepower and torque than previous Raptor\u2019s 411-horsepower, 434-lb.-ft. 6.2-liter V8, plus an all-new 10-speed transmission.\n\nThe all-new Raptor will be built at Dearborn Truck Plant, and goes on sale fall 2016.",

But nothing compares to seeing F-150 Raptor do what it does best.\n\nShot on the same Mojave Desert terrain where F-150 Raptor was designed and tested to excel, this video is a six-part series that shows why F-150 Raptor is the ultimate high-performance off-road pickup truck.\n\nForged from high-strength, military-grade, aluminum alloy that helps the truck shed more than 500 pounds, F-150 Raptor is inspired by Ford\u2019s performance heritage in off-road racing that includes Best in the Desert, Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series and the famous Baja 1000.\n\nRedesigned, larger FOX Racing Shox with more suspension travel and all-new terrain management technology help F-150 Raptor tackle the toughest of surfaces. An available Torsen front differential increases off-road capability further.\n\nThe all-new 2017 Raptor is powered by Ford\u2019s new, second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost\u00ae engine, with more horsepower and torque than previous Raptor\u2019s 411-horsepower, 434-lb.-ft. 6.2-liter V8, plus an all-new 10-speed transmission.\n\nThe all-new Raptor will be built at Dearborn Truck Plant, and goes on sale fall 2016.",
